**What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?** Benefits I can account for Kanban work is the ability to see small successes along the way of the project development, which provides dopamine hits that keep ADHD brains motivated. The visual nature helps the team quickly understand priorities without being overwhelming, and the flexibility allows to adapt wwhen we need to pivot based on user feedback.

Challenges include project constantly growing with new features, which is problematic for team members who struggle with executive function. The constant collaboration can be draining for our neurodivergent team, and without strong leadership, flexibility can become chaotic. Time estimation remains difficult for ADHD brains due to time blindness.

**How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?** It recenters my focus towards customer feedback rather than assumptions, which is crucial when building for neurodivergent users. Breaking tasks into smaller chunks and scheduling frequent meetings/collaborations makes my work less overwhelming and helps me stay focused, while the iterative approach lets me see the impact of my work quickly rather than waiting months to know if I'm on the right track.

**Differences between Kanban and Scrum** Kanban and Scrum is very similar in their core values, but Kanban focuses on continuous flow while Scrum works in fixed time periods called sprints. Kanban limits how much work you can do at once to avoid overwhelm, while Scrum plans everything upfront for each sprint. Essentially, Kanban is more flexible and continuous, while Scrum provides more structure combined with regular check-ins.

**Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.** "Responding to change over following a plan" will be most useful in my social media work. Social media trends shift constantly, algorithms change, and what resonates with our neurospicy community can be unpredictable, this requires me to be on my feet and be prepared to pivot and make the appropriate changes.
