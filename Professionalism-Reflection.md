**Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?** During our university project creating campaign strategies for Invictus Australia, our team succeeded because we divided tasks based on individual strengths. We held weekly check-ins with clear agendas and always came prepared.

**What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?** I will keep my communications concise and will check if people understand by asking "Any questions?" and adjust my style based on feedback. My goal is to be clear and helpful, not to sound smart, which works better for everyone.

**How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?** I'll celebrate team wins, offer help when needed, and contribute ideas with enthusiasm. I keep things light with appropriate humor while always meeting my commitments. Most importantly, I aim to treat everyone with respect and bring genuine energy for our shared goals.

**How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?** I'll review the agenda beforehand, prepare specific questions or updates about my projects, and bring a notebook to take notes. I'll think through any challenges I'm facing and potential solutions to discuss. I always arrive a few minutes early and silence my phone to stay focused and respectful.

**What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?** I'll anticipate needs by researching industry trends, suggesting content ideas before being asked, and identifying process improvements. I'll ask for additional responsibilities when I finish tasks early and proactively communicate project updates rather than waiting to be asked.

**How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?** I'll send a polite follow-up email after 2-3 business days, then try a different communication method (in-person) after another 2 days. I'd escalate to their supervisor only if it's blocking critical work and after a week of no response, always keeping my supervisor informed.

**What are some things you won't do?** I won't gossip about colleagues, skip proper channels for decision-making, make committments or posts on the behalf of the company without approval and work on personal projects during company time.
