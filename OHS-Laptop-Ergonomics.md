**What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)** Utilize an external monitor, adjust chairs so feet are flat, backs supported, and elbows at 90 degrees.

**What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)**  Position monitor tops at or below eye level, 50-55 cm away. Keep keyboards at elbow height with clear leg space and adequate lighting.

**How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)** I could use Focus Bear to schedule automatic movement breaks (micro-breaks) every 30 minutes, this includes doing short office exercises like shoulder rolls or neck stretches. I can also set hourly reminder on my phone to check my posture.
