**What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?** As a Social Media Strategist intern, I create content for our neurodivergent community, monitor engagement, and gather user feedback from social media platforms. I contribute to our Kanban process by providing real-time user insights that help our product team understand what features are working and what pain points users are experiencing.

**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?** I collect user feedback from social media and share it with everyone on the team. I tell developers about bugs users find, give the Product Manager ideas about what users want and update our Project Manager on what's urgent.

**TASK**

**Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.** I gather real-time user feedback from social platforms and translate it into actionable insights that drive our Kanban board priorities, making sure we're building what our ADHD/autism community actually needs rather than just what we think they want.

**Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.** I frequently collaborate with the Product Manager since I provide user feedback that informs product decisions. To improve our teamwork, I aim to categorize feedbacks by priority (urgent vs wishlist), and ask for regular check-ins to understand upcoming features so I can gather more targeted user feedback.
