**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?** Kanban helps manage priorities by establishing clear visual workflows and limiting work-in-progress. The board shows exactly what's being worked on and what's waiting, while WIP limits prevents taking on more tasks than we can handle. 

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?** I can improve my workflow through visualizing my content pipeline with columns like "Ideas," "Creating," and "Published," limiting my work-in-progress to avoid starting too many posts at once, and setting clear rules for when content can move between columns.
