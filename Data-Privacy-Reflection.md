**What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?** I'll ensure data security by using strong, unique passwords with 2FA on all work accounts and only accessing customer data that's necessary for my specific tasks. I stay alert for phishing attempts, never share login credentials, and always verify I have proper authorization before accessing any personal data.

**How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?** The best way I believe is to store all sensitive data within our approved company systems with encryption and never save customer information to my personal devices or cloud accounts. When sharing data, I'll verify the recipient's idenity and their legitimate needs. For disposal, I'll follow our data retention policies by securely deleting files when no longer needed and properly shredding any paper documentation containing personal information.

**What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?** As a Focus Bear intern, I'll aim to avoid privacy mistakes by double-checking email recipients, never discussing customer data publicly, logging out of shared computers, avoiding personal cloud storage for work, and escalating concerns to the appropriate superior instead of guessing.
