**My Role** I'm interning as a Social Media Strategist, I will be working remote on the Tuesdays and is available in-person on the Fridays each week. I'll be interning for 15 working days.

**What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)** I work best with clear, direct communication about expectations and deadlines, plus context on why we're doing something so I can contribute strategically. I appreciate respect for focused work time while staying available for collaboration and support when needed.

**How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)** I prefer async messages for updates and non-urgent matters, but quick video calls for complex discussions where tone matters. I like using written communication for clarity and face-to-face conversations for brainstorming and building rapport.

**What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)** I work best with deep work sessions where I can dive into complex tasks without interruptions, combined with structured to-do lists that break down projects into actionable steps. I also work best in a collaborative environment where I can bounce ideas off teammates and feel connected to the broader team goals.

**How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)** I appreciate clear, direct feedback with specific examples so I can improve quickly. I prefer receiving feedback promptly rather than waiting for formal reviews, and I value written follow-ups so I can track my progress. When giving feedback, I focus on being constructive and solution-oriented.

**What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)** I'm naturally curious and ask "why" questions to understand the bigger picture, which helps me spot potential improvements. I prefer to over-communicate with quick updates, take detailed notes during meetings, and always want to understand how my work connects to larger company goals.
