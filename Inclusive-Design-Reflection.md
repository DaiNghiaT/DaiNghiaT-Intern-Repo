**How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?** I will aim to use simple, clear words and giving specific examples instead of confusing instructions. I will ask teammates how they like to communicate and share meeting topics ahead of time, I will be patient when people need extra time to process information and will offer different ways to find what they need. For social media content, I will use easy-to-read colors and fonts and keep layouts consistent.

**What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?** Focus Bear app could become less accessible with overwhelming onboarding flows, rigid time limits without flexibility, complex navigation between features and assuming all Neurospicy users want the same level of detail in notifications and feedback.

**What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations** I will be creating a simple content template with consistent language patterns and clear calls-to-action for every post, ensuring our messaging is predictable and easy to follow for ASD/ADHD users who benefit from clear structure over creative but confusing content.

**TASKS**

**Focus Bear Improvment Suggestion** Context-based blocking - Instead of one blocklist for all situations, implement context-based blocking that adapts based on the type of work session (Creative work/Admin work/Research), example: Admin work would block everything except email and work tools.

**Example Respone** 
Hey (User's Name),

You're not alone in this struggle, and it's not a reflection of your worth. Executive functioning is genuinely difficult so you're not lazy or broken.

**Try starting impossibly small**: instead of "clean my room," try "put one item away." Success helps build momentum.

**Work with your brain, not against it**: notice when you feel most capable and tackle important tasks then. Use visual reminders and break everything into tiny steps.

**Remember**: What's "simple" for others might genuinely be hard for you, and that's completely valid.

Take it one small step at a time. You've got this.
Best wishes,
Focus Bear Team
