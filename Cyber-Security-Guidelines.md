**Reflections**:

**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?** I'm doing well with the fundamentals: I use biometric identification and utilize a password manager for quick device access, have MFA enabled on my important accounts, and run antivirus software for malware protection. These three create a solid security foundation.

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?** I'll link security to existing routines (check updates with morning coffee), set up automatic systems (auto-updates, auto-backups), and use simple triggers like "verify first, click second."

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?** I'll set up a password manager, replace all reused passwords with unique ones and enable MFA on critical accounts. I'm cleaning up old accounts and using my password manager for all future passwords.

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?** I'll immediately change passwords on affected accounts, enable MFA if not already active, and document everything with screenshots. If it's a phishing email targeting Focus Bear, I'm notifying their security team right away.
